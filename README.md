#### Local setup using Docker (Recommended)

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running in your local machine:

- First, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Then, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

Finally, run the following command that will pull a pre-built image from Docker and will run your website.

```bash
./bin/docker_run.sh
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 300MB or so.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, you can use the same command (`bin/docker_run.sh`) to render the webpage with all you changes. Also, make sure to commit your final changes. It's also possible to change port number by editing the `docker_run.sh` file.


---

#### Local Setup (Legacy)

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --future
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.

---

#### Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

**For personal and organization webpages:**
1. Rename your repository to `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
2. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
3. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
4. Make changes, commit, and push!
5. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

**For project pages:**
1. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/<your-repository-name>/`.
2. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
3. Make changes, commit, and push!
4. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

**To enable automatic deployment:**
1. Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.
2. Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.
3. Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `master` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch.
4. Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `master`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).


<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Manual deployment to GitHub Pages:</strong></summary>

If you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, run the deploy script from the root directory of your repository:
```bash
./bin/deploy
```
uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.

</details>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Deployment to another hosting server (non GitHub Pages):</strong></summary>

If you decide to not use GitHub Pages and host your page elsewhere, simply run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```
which will (re-)generate the static webpage in the `_site/` folder.
Then simply copy the contents of the `_site/` foder to your hosting server.

**Note:** Make sure to correctly set the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to `your-domain.com/your-project/`, you must set `url: your-domain.com` and `baseurl: /your-project/`. If you are deploing directly to `your-domain.com`, leave `baseurl` blank.

</details>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Deployment to a separate repository (advanced users only):</strong></summary>

**Note:** Do not try using this method unless you know what you are doing (make sure you are familiar with [publishing sources](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)). This approach allows to have the website's source code in one repository and the deployment version in a different repository.

Let's assume that your website's publishing source is a `publishing-source` sub-directory of a git-versioned repository cloned under `$HOME/repo/`.
For a user site this could well be something like `$HOME/<user>.github.io`.

Firstly, from the deployment repo dir, checkout the git branch hosting your publishing source.

Then from the website sources dir (commonly your al-folio fork's clone):
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build --destination $HOME/repo/publishing-source
```

This will instruct jekyll to deploy the website under `$HOME/repo/publishing-source`.

**Note:** Jekyll will clean `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` before building!

The quote below is taken directly from the [jekyll configuration docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/):

> Destination folders are cleaned on site builds
>
> The contents of `<destination>` are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the `<keep_files>` configuration directive.
>
> Do not use an important location for `<destination>`; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.

If `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` contains files that you want jekyll to leave untouched, specify them under `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.
In its default configuration, al-folio will copy the top-level `README.md` to the publishing source. If you want to change this behaviour, add `README.md` under `exclude` in `_config.yml`.

**Note:** Do _not_ run `jekyll clean` on your publishing source repo as this will result in the entire directory getting deleted, irrespective of the content of `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.

### FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions.
If you have a different question, please ask using [Discussions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/discussions/categories/q-a).

1. **Q:** After I fork and setup the repo, I get a deployment error.
   Isn't the website supposed to correctly deploy automatically? <br>
   **A:** Yes, if you are using release `v0.3.5` or later, the website will automatically and correctly re-deploy right after your first commit.
   Please make some changes (e.g., change your website info in `_config.yml`), commit, and push.
   Make sure to follow [deployment instructions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#deployment) in the previous section.
   (Relevant issue: [209](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/209#issuecomment-798849211).)

2. **Q:** I am using a custom domain (e.g., `foo.com`).
   My custom domain becomes blank in the repository settings after each deployment.
   How do I fix that? <br>
   **A:** You need to add `CNAME` file to the `master` or `source` branch of your repository.
   The file should contain your custom domain name.
   (Relevant issue: [130](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/130).)

3. **Q:** My webpage works locally.
    But after deploying, it is not displayed correctly (CSS and JS is not loaded properly).
    How do I fix that? <br>
   **A:** Make sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`.
   Set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` or to `https://<your.custom.domain>` if you are using a custom domain.
   If you are deploying a personal or organization website, leave `baseurl` blank.
   If you are deploying a project page, set `baseurl: /<your-project-name>/`.

4. **Q:** Atom feed doesn't work. Why?
   <br>
   **A:** Make sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`.
  RSS Feed plugin works with these correctly set up fields: `title`, `url`, `description` and `author`.
  Make sure to fill them in an appropriate way and try again.


## Features

### Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/publications-screenshot.png" width=800></p>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Author annotation:</strong></summary>

In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in `_config.yml`:
```
scholar:
  last_name: [Einstein]
  first_name: [Albert, A.]
```
If the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined.
Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.
The coauthor data format in `_data/coauthors.yml` is as follows,
```
"Adams":
  - firstname: ["Edwin", "E.", "E. P.", "Edwin Plimpton"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams

"Podolsky":
  - firstname: ["Boris", "B.", "B. Y.", "Boris Yakovlevich"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky

"Rosen":
  - firstname: ["Nathan", "N."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen

"Bach":
  - firstname: ["Johann Sebastian", "J. S."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach

  - firstname: ["Carl Philipp Emanuel", "C. P. E."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach
```
If the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided.

</details>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Buttons (through custom bibtex keywords):</strong></summary>

There are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:
   
- `abbr`: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.
- `abstract`: Adds an "Abs" button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text
- `arxiv`: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
- `bibtex_show`: Adds a "Bib" button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry
- `html`: Inserts a "HTML" button redirecting to the user-specified link
- `pdf`: Adds a "PDF" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `supp`: Adds a "Supp" button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `blog`: Adds a "Blog" button redirecting to the specified link
- `code`: Adds a "Code" button redirecting to the specified link
- `poster`: Adds a "Poster" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `slides`: Adds a "Slides" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `website`: Adds a "Website" button redirecting to the specified link
   
You can implement your own buttons by editing the bib.html file.

### Collections

This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories.
The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`.
Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page.
Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/projects-screenshot.png" width=700></p>

You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is.
To do this, edit the collections in the `_config.yml` file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`.

---

### Layouts

**al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts.

#### The iconic style of Distill

The theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) style:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/distill-screenshot.png" width=700></a></p>

For more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `<d-*>` tags, please refer to [the example](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/).

#### Full support for math & code

**al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes):

<p align="center">
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/math/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/math-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/code/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/code-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
</p>

#### Photos

Photo formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/).
Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/1_project/">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/photos-screenshot.png" width="75%">
  </a>
</p>

---

### Other features

#### GitHub repositories and user stats
**al-folio** uses [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) to display GitHub repositories and user stats on the the `/repositories/` page.

Edit the `_data/repositories.yml` and change the `github_users` and `github_repos` lists to include your own GitHub profile and repositories to the the `/repositories/` page.

You may also use the following codes for displaying this in any other pages.
```
<!-- code for GitHub users -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_users %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %}
    {% include repository/repo_user.html username=user %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- code for GitHub repositories -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
    {% include repository/repo.html repository=repo %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```

#### Theming
A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the 
`--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.
The stock theme color options available can be found at `_sass/variables.scss`.
You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of
use across the template.

#### Social media previews
**al-folio** supports preview images on social media.
To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your `_config.yml`.
Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews.
This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable.
If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your `_config.yml`.
In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.

#### Atom (RSS-like) Feed
It generates an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your posts, useful for Atom and RSS readers.
The feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`.
E.g. assuming your website mountpoint is the main folder, you can type `yourusername.github.io/feed.xml`
