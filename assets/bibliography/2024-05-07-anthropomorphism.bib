  author   = "Contro, Jack and Brandão, Martim",
  abstract = "In this paper we show that with the increasing integration of
              social robots into daily life, concerns arise regarding their
              impact on the potential for creating emotional dependency. Using
              findings from the literature in Human-Robot Interaction,
              Human-Computer Interaction, Internet studies and Political
              Economics, we argue that current design and governance paradigms
              incentivize the creation of emotionally dependent relationships
              between humans and robots. To counteract this, we introduce
              Interaction Minimalism, a design philosophy that aims to minimize
              unnecessary interactions between humans and robots, and instead
              promote human-human relationships, hereby mitigating the risk of
              emotional dependency. By focusing on functionality without
              fostering dependency, this approach encourages autonomy, enhances
              human-human interactions, and advocates for minimal data
              extraction. Through hypothetical design examples, we demonstrate
              the viability of Interaction Minimalism in promoting healthier
              human-robot relationships. Our discussion extends to the
              implications of this design philosophy for future robot
              development, emphasizing the need for a shift towards more ethical
              practices that prioritize human well-being and privacy.",

               chatbots can produce coherent and continuous word sequences that
               mirror natural human language. While the use of natural language
               and human-like conversation styles enables the use of chatbots
               within a range of everyday settings, these usability-enhancing
               features can also have unintended consequences, such as making
               fallible information seem trustworthy by emphasizing friendliness
               and closeness. This can have serious implications for information
               retrieval tasks performed with chatbots. In this paper, we
               provide an overview of the literature on parasociality, social
               affordance, and trust to bridge these concepts within human-AI
               interactions. We critically examine how chatbot “roleplaying” and
               user role projection co-produce a pseudo-interactive,
               technologically-mediated space with imbalanced dynamics between
               users and chatbots. Based on the review of the literature, we
               develop a conceptual framework of parasociality in chatbots that
               describes interactions between humans and anthropomorphized
               chatbots. We dissect how chatbots use personal pronouns,
               conversational conventions, affirmations, and similar strategies
               to position the chatbots as users’ companions or assistants, and
               how these tactics induce trust-forming behaviors in users.
               Finally, based on the conceptual framework, we outline a set of
               ethical concerns that emerge from parasociality, including
               illusions of reciprocal engagement, task misalignment, and leaks
               of sensitive information. This paper argues that these possible
               consequences arise from a positive feedback cycle wherein
               anthropomorphized chatbot features encourage users to fill in the
               context around predictive outcomes.",

We present AnthroScore, an automatic metric of implicit anthropomorphism in language. We use a masked language model to quantify how non-human entities are implicitly framed as human by the surrounding context. We show that AnthroScore corresponds with human judgments of anthropomorphism and dimensions of anthropomorphism described in social science literature. Motivated by concerns of misleading anthropomorphism in computer science discourse, we use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of research papers and downstream news articles. In research papers, we find that anthropomorphism has steadily increased over time, and that papers related to language models have the most anthropomorphism. Within ACL papers, temporal increases in anthropomorphism are correlated with key neural advancements. Building upon concerns of scientific misinformation in mass media, we identify higher levels of anthropomorphism in news headlines compared to the research papers they cite. Since AnthroScore is lexicon-free, it can be directly applied to a wide range of text sources.",

  abstract  = "Chatbots are a burgeoning opportunity for news media outlets to
               disseminate their content in a conversational way, and create an
               engaging experience around it. Since chatbots are social and
               interactive technologies, they might be effective tools to lower
               the threshold of engaging with news content containing opposing
               views. In an experiment, we test this idea by investigating
               whether people are more likely to accept a news article
               containing conflicting views when it is delivered by a chatbot,
               as compared with the same article on a news website. The results
               indicated that people agreed more to a counter-attitudinal news
               article when it was delivered by a news chatbot (compared with
               the website article). In addition, users also perceived this
               chatbot article as more credible. The underlying process for this
               effect was that people attributed human-like characteristics to
               the chatbot on an implicit level (i.e., perceived mindless
               anthropomorphism). These results are discussed in the light of
               their potential contribution to an informed public discourse and
               a decrease in polarization in our society.",

  abstract  = "Artificial intelligence (AI) has historically been conceptualized
               in anthropomorphic terms. Some algorithms deploy biomimetic
               designs in a deliberate attempt to effect a sort of digital
               isomorphism of the human brain. Others leverage more general
               learning strategies that happen to coincide with popular theories
               of cognitive science and social epistemology. In this paper, I
               challenge the anthropomorphic credentials of the neural network
               algorithm, whose similarities to human cognition I argue are
               vastly overstated and narrowly construed. I submit that three
               alternative supervised learning methods—namely lasso penalties,
               bagging, and boosting—offer subtler, more interesting analogies
               to human reasoning as both an individual and a social phenomenon.
               Despite the temptation to fall back on anthropomorphic tropes
               when discussing AI, however, I conclude that such rhetoric is at
               best misleading and at worst downright dangerous. The impulse to
               humanize algorithms is an obstacle to properly conceptualizing
               the ethical challenges posed by emerging technologies.",

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how people’s level of trust (as reported through self-assessment) in so-called “AI” (artificial intelligence) is influenced by anthropomorphizing language in system descriptions. Building on prior work, we define four categories of anthropomorphization (1. Properties of a cognizer, 2. Agency, 3. Biological metaphors, and 4. Properties of a communicator). We use a survey-based approach (n=954) to investigate whether participants are likely to trust one of two (fictitious) “AI” systems by randomly assigning people to see either an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the systems. We find that participants are no more likely to trust anthropomorphized over de-anthropmorphized product descriptions overall. The type of product or system in combination with different anthropomorphic categories appears to exert greater influence on trust than anthropomorphizing language alone, and age is the only demographic factor that significantly correlates with people’s preference for anthropomorphized or de-anthropomorphized descriptions. When elaborating on their choices, participants highlight factors such as lesser of two evils, lower or higher stakes contexts, and human favoritism as driving motivations when choosing between product A and B, irrespective of whether they saw an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the product. Our results suggest that “anthropomorphism” in “AI” descriptions is an aggregate concept that may influence different groups differently, and provide nuance to the discussion of whether anthropomorphization leads to higher trust and over-reliance by the general public in systems sold as “AI”.},
