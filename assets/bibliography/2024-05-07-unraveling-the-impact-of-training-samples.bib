 abstract = {This paper treats essentially the first derivative of an estimator viewed as functional and the ways in which it can be used to study local robustness properties. A theory of robust estimation "near" strict parametric models is briefly sketched and applied to some classical situations. Relations between von Mises functionals, the jackknife and U-statistics are indicated. A number of classical and new estimators are discussed, including trimmed and Winsorized means, Huber-estimators, and more generally maximum likelihood and M-estimators. Finally, a table with some numerical robustness properties is given.},

    abstract = {A maximum likelihood fit of a logistic regression model (and other similar models) is extremely sensitive to outlying responses and extreme points in the design space. We develop diagnostic measures to aid the analyst in detecting such observations and in quantifying their effect on various aspects of the maximum likelihood fit. The elements of the fitting process which constitute the usual output (parameter estimates, standard errors, residuals, etc.) will be used for this purpose. With a properly designed computing package for fitting the usual maximum-likelihood model, the diagnostics are essentially "free for the asking." In particular, good data analysis for logistic regression models need not be expensive or time-consuming.},
