# Call for blog posts
​
We invite all researchers and practitioners to submit a blog post discussing work previously published at a top-tier venue to the ICLR 2024 blog post track.
The format and process for this blog post track are described below.
​

### Content
​
Write a post on a subject that has been published at a top-tier venue (ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI, UAI, CVPR, SIGGRAPH, ECCV, ICCV, etc.) relatively recently.
Past blog posts can be accessed [here](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2023/about).
​

### Conflict of interest
​
The authors of the blog posts will have to declare their conflicts of interest (positive or negative) with the paper (and their authors) they write about.
Conflicts of interest include:

  - Recent collaborators (less than 3 years)
  - Current institution 
​
Reviewers will be asked to judge if the submission is sufficiently critical and objective of the papers addressed in the blog post.
**Blog Posts must not be used to highlight or advertise past publications of the authors or of their lab**. 


### Publication

##### Blog post
​
The posts will be created and published under a unified template; see [the submission instructions]({{ '/submitting' | relative_url }}) and the [sample post]({{ '/blog/2024/distill-example' | relative_url }}) hosted on the blog of this website. 

##### Poster
Additionally, accepted posts will have the option to present their work as a poster during the main poster session. For more information about the main poster session (time, poster format, etc.) please refer to the ICLR homepage.

### Review

Blogs will be peer-reviewed (double-blind) for quality and novelty of the content: clarity and pedagogy of the exposition, new theoretical or practical insights, reproduction/extension of experiments, etc.
The review is dual-anonymous assuming good faith from both submitters and reviewers (see [the submission instructions]({{ '/submitting' | relative_url }}) for more details).
