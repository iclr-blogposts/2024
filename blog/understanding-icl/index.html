It is a simple technique used daily and throughout the world by AI practitioners of all backgrounds, to improve generation quality and alignment of LLMs <d-cite key="Brown2020"></d-cite>. ICL is important because it addresses full-on the once widespread criticism that for all their impressive performance, modern deep learning models are rigid systems that lack the ability to adapt quickly to novel tasks in dynamic settings - a hallmark of biological intelligence. By this new form of “learning during inference”, Large Language Models have shown that they can be, in some specific sense (once pretrained), surprisingly versatile and few-shot learners.</p> <p><img src="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-understanding-icl/in-context-chatgpt.png" alt="transformer" class="l-body rounded z-depth-1 center" width="80%"></p> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Example of a simple in-context prompt for ChatGPT.</p> </div> <p>Interestingly, it was around the release of <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-2</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a> that researchers observed that an auto-regressive language model pre-trained on enough data with enough parameters was capable of performing arbitrary tasks without fine-tuning, by simply prompting the model with the task with few examples and letting it generate the output. In recent months, the research community has started to investigate the phenomenon of ICL in more details, and several papers have been published on the topic.</p> <iframe src="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-understanding-icl/arxiv-icl.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" class="l-body rounded z-depth-1"></iframe> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: The number of papers published on the topic of ICL (and transformers) in the last years.

In the last year alone, the number of papers on the topic has increased by more than 200%.</p> </div> <p><br></p> <p>Specifically, since learning processes in biology and machine are often, if not always, understood in terms of iterative optimization, it is natural to ask what kind of iterative optimization is being realized during ICL, and how.</p> <h3 id="from-large-language-models-to-regression-tasks">From large language models to regression tasks</h3> <p>Though ICL is generally regarded as a phenomenon exhibited by LLMs, we now hasten to study it in a non-language, small-scale model that enables more control and where ICL can still be shown to emerge. This simpler situation is that of a transformer model trained to regress a set of numerical data points presented in the prompt, with data points generated from a distinct function for each prompt, but where all prompts sample a function from the same general class (i.e. linear) at train and at test time. We will see that to some extent, this simplification allows for a mathematical treatment of ICL.</p> <p>The following figure gives a visual representation of the ICL setup we will consider in this blog post. The model is a generic transformer pre-trained to solve generic linear regression tasks. At inference time, we can give the model a prompt with a new linear regression task, and it is able to solve it with surprisingly good performance.</p> <iframe src="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-understanding-icl/regression-interactive.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" class="l-body rounded z-depth-1"></iframe> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: The model is pre-trained to regress linear functions, and frozen during inference.

Pay attention to the fact that while the model is frozen during inference, it can still recover the exact prediction for the new query point, given the context points, for any linear function. This is the essence of ICL.</p> </aside> <h3 id="objective-of-this-blog-post">Objective of this blog post</h3> <p>The objective of this blog post is to understand how ICL is possible, and to present in an interactive way what is known of its underlying mechanism. Specifically, we will analyze the results reported in the paper <em>Transformers Learn In-Context by Gradient Descent</em> by J. von Oswald et al. recently published in ICML 2023 <d-cite key="oswald23a"></d-cite>, which first showed that a simplified transformer model learns in-context by gradient descent. We will replicate the authors’ findings and then we will complement the discussion with a number of additional insights, before pointing to open questions. We hope the reader comes out of this post with a better vision of what <em>fundamentally</em> ICL is and the open challenges that remain.</p> <aside class="l-body box-important"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This blog post should not be regarded as a survey on ICL, but rather a deep dive into the core mechanisms of ICL, with a focus on the paper by J. von Oswald et al <d-cite key="oswald23a"></d-cite>. For this reason, we will not cover language modeling tasks, but we will solely focus on the regression task, which is a simpler setting that allows for a more detailed analysis of the ICL phenomenon.</p> </aside> <h2 id="preliminaries-and-notations">Preliminaries and notations</h2> <p>First of all we need to agree on a mathematical formalization of in-context learning.</p> <p>Before we start, let’s introduce some notation and color convention that will be used throughout the rest of the blog post. We will use the following colors to denote different quantities:</p> <ul> <li> <span style="color: rgb(107, 140, 188)"><b>blue</b></span>: inputs</li> <li> <span style="color: rgb(130, 178, 102)"><b>green</b></span>: model parameters</li> <li> <span style="color: rgb(214, 154, 0)"><b>yellow</b></span>: output</li> </ul> <p>Vectors will be denoted with bold letters, e.g. \(\mba\), and matrices with bold capital letters, e.g. \(\mbA\). Additional notation will be introduced in-line when needed.</p> <p>Formally, let’s define \(p(\mbx)\) as a probability distribution over inputs \(\mbx\in\cX\) and \(\cH\) a class of functions \(h: \cX \rightarrow \cY\). You can think of \(\cH\) as a set of functions that share some common properties, for example, the set of all linear functions, or the set of all functions that can be represented by a neural network with a given architecture. Also, let’s define \(p(h)\) as a probability measure over \(\cH\).</p> <iframe src="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-understanding-icl/class-of-functions.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" class="l-body rounded z-depth-1"></iframe> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: Visual representation of various parametric function classes (linear, sinusoidal, shallow neural network). Use the dropdown menu to select the function class.</p> </div> <p><br></p> <p>Following the terminology of the LLM community, let’s define a <em>prompt</em> \(P\) of length \(C\) as a <em>sequence</em> of \(2C+1\) points \((\mbx_0, h(\mbx_0), \ldots, \mbx_{C-1}, h(\mbx_{C-1}), \mbx_{\text{query}})\) where inputs (\(\mbx_i\) and \(\mbx_{\text{query}}\)) are independently and identically drawn from \(p(\mbx)\), and \(h\) is drawn from \(\cH\). In short we will also write \(P_C = \left[\{\mbx_i, h(\mbx_i)\}_{i=0}^{C-1}, \mbx_\text{query}\right]\).</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p>We posit that a model demonstrates <em>in-context learning for a function class \(\cH\)</em> if, for any function \(h \in\cH\), the model can effectively approximate \(h(\mbx_{\text{query}})\) for any new query input \(\textcolor{myblue}{\mbx}_{\text{query}}\). In other words, we say that a class of transformer models \(\cF\) learns in-context for a function class \(\cH\) if, for any \(\epsilon(C) &gt; 0\), there exists a model \(f\in\cF\) such that the following inequality holds:</p> \[\begin{equation} \label{eq:in-context-error} \mathbb{E}_{\mbx,\mbx_{\text{query}}, \; h}\left[\ell\left(f(P_C), h\left(\mbx_{\text{query}}\right)\right) \right] \leq \epsilon(C), \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\ell\) is a loss function that measures the distance between the model output and the target function value, and the expectation is taken over \(p(\mbx)\) and the random choice of \(h\in\cH\) (the prompt \(P_C\) is constructed as described in the previous paragraph).</p> </aside> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: The expectation in Equation \eqref{eq:in-context-error} is taken over the randomness of the input and the function.

However, the two losses are equivalent by construction, hence the two procedures are equivalent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Because the construction of the GD transformer is not unique, it’s not easy to see the effect of the GD learning rate once we compare it with the trained linear transformer. Recall that due to its parametrization, the linear transformer does not have an explicit \(\eta\) parameter, which it can be absorbed in any of the weight matrices in the linear self-attention layer. Yet, the linear transformer converges to the exact same loss of the GD-transformer for the optimal GD learning rate \(\eta^*\). This is expected because fundamentally the loss function used for the line search and the one used for the analytical solution is equivalent to the loss in Equation \eqref{eq:pre-train-loss-expectation} used during the transformer training.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Said differently, what we did in two steps for the GD-transformer (first build the \(\mbW^K, \mbW^Q, \mbW^V\) matrices, then find the optimal GD learning rate) is done implicitly during the training of the linear transformer.</p> <p>The following table summarizes the three different procedures we have discussed so far.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th>Loss function</th> <th>GD learning rate</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Least-squares regression</td> <td>\(\cL_\text{lin}(\mbw-\Delta \mbw)\)</td> <td>Explicit \(\eta^*\) by analytical solution</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GD-transformer</td> <td>\(\cL(\mbtheta_\text{GD})\)</td> <td>Explicit \(\eta^*\) by line search</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Linear transformer</td> <td>\(\cL(\mbtheta)\)</td> <td>Implicit \(\eta^*\) by training \(\mbtheta\)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Finally, one comment on the computational complexity of the two procedures. It doesn’t come as a surprise that the analytical solution is faster to compute than the line search: the line search requires on average 10 seconds to find the optimal GD learning rate, while the analytical solution requires only 10 milliseconds (both with JAX’s JIT compilation turned on, run on the same GPU).</p> <aside class="l-body box-important"> <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The analytical solution for the optimal GD learning rate \(\eta^*\) agrees well with the line search procedure and it is faster to compute.</li> <li>Training a linear transformer implicitly finds the optimal GD learning rate \(\eta^*\).</li> </ul> </aside> <h3 id="if-one-layer-is-a-gd-step-what-about-multiple-layers">If one layer is a GD step, what about multiple layers?</h3> <p>It is only natural to ask if the same behavior is observed for a linear transformer with multiple layers.

What about LSTMs?</h2> <p>Transformers are not the only architecture that can sequence-to-sequence models <d-cite key="Sutskever2014"></d-cite>. Notably, <em>recurrent neural networks</em> (RNNs) have been used for a long time to implement sequence-to-sequence models, and in particular <em>long short-term memory</em> (LSTM) networks have been shown to be very effective in many tasks <d-cite key="Hochreiter1997"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Indeed, from a modeling perspective, nothing prevents us from using a LSTM to implement in-context learning for regression tasks. In fact, we can use the same experimental setup as before, but replacing the transformer with a LSTM. The main architectural difference between a LSTM and a transformer is that LSTM layers are by-design causal, i.e. they can only attend to previous tokens in the sequence, while transformers can attend to any token in the sequence. While for some tasks where order matters, like language modeling, this is a desirable property<d-cite key="VinyalsBK15"></d-cite>, for the regression task we are considering this is not the case, since the input sequence is not ordered (i.e. shuffling the input sequence does not change the output of the linear regression model). For this reason, together with the classic uni-directional LSTM, we will also consider a bi-directional LSTM, which can attend to both previous and future tokens in the sequence. This provides a fair comparison between the LSTMs and the transformers.</p> <p>In this first experiment, we analyze the performance of the uni-directional and the bi-directional LSTM to learn linear functions in-context. Note that because of the intrinsic non-linear nature of the LSTM layers, we cannot manually construct a LSTM that implements a gradient descent step, as we did for the transformer. Nonetheless, we can still compare the LSTMs with the GD-equivalent transformer (which we now know it implements a gradient descent step on the least-squares regression loss).</p> <iframe src="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-understanding-icl/lstm-comparison-1.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" class="l-body rounded z-depth-1"></iframe> <div class="l-gutter caption"> <b>Figure 14</b>: LSTMs cannot learn linear functions in-context as effectively as transformers and bi-directional LSTMs can learn linear functions in-context better than uni-directional LSTMs. Use the slider to change the number of layers. </div> <p><br></p> <p>In this figure we can see that a single layer LSTM is not sufficient to learn linear functions in-context.

In particular, we also derive an analytical solution for the best GD learning rate, which is faster to compute than the line search procedure used in the original paper. Finally, we also empirically show that LSTMs behave differently than transformers, and that single layer LSTMs do not in fact implement a gradient descent step.

This is the common approach in the literature, including very recent additions <d-cite key="fu2023transformers"></d-cite>, and it is the approach we have followed in this blog post. However, this can pose significant limitations regarding the generalization of the results and the applicability of the findings to other architectures (notably, causal self-attention layers). Phenomena like the emergent abilities <d-cite key="wei2022emergent"></d-cite> or the memorization <d-cite key="biderman2023emergent"></d-cite> of large language models may indicate that fundamentally different mechanisms are at play in these models, and that the optimization perspective might not be sufficient to understand them.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the other hand, nothing prevents us from working in the opposite direction, i.e. to start from specific learning algorithms and try to design neural networks that implement them. From an alignment perspective, for example, this is desirable because it allows us to start by designing objective functions and learning algorithms that are more interpretable and more aligned with our objectives, rather than starting from a black-box neural network and trying to understand its behavior. In this quest, the developing theory of mesa-optimization <d-cite key="hubinger2021risks"></d-cite> can represent a useful framework to understand these large models <d-cite key="vonoswald2023uncovering"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we want to highlight that the main results shown in this blog post are consequences of the simplified hypothesis and the experimental setup we have considered (linear functions, least-squares regression loss, linear self-attention layers). In an equally recent paper <d-cite key="geshkovski2023the"></d-cite>, for example, the authors take a completely different route: by representing transformers as interacting particle systems, they were able to show that tokens tend to cluster to limiting objects, which are dependent on the input context. This suggests that other interpretations of the behavior of transformers are not only possible, but also possibly necessary to understand how these models learn in context.</p> </li> </ol> <div style="display: none"> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <h3 id="connection-with-meta-learning">Connection with meta-learning</h3> <p>From a learning point-of-view, ICL seems closely related to the definition of <em>meta-learning</em>, where the goal is to learn a model that can quickly adapt to new tasks <d-cite key="schmidhuber_evolutionary_1987"></d-cite><d-cite key="bengio_learning_1990"></d-cite><d-cite key="finn_model-agnostic_2017"></d-cite>. If we consider the function class \(\cH\) as an uncountable set of tasks, then the model is learning <em>how</em> to adapt to new function by observing a few examples of that function. The main difference between the classic formulation of meta-learning and the formulation of in-context learning is that in the latter case the model is not allowed to change its weights, but it can only change its internal state (e.g., the hidden activations of the transformer). Indeed, meta-learning relies on the assumption that the model can quickly adapt to new tasks by changing its weights (i.e. by taking one or more gradient steps).</p> <h4 id="connection-with-maml-model-agnostic-meta-learning">Connection with MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)</h4> <p>In the meta-learning setup, we need to define a generic base-model \(m:\cX\rightarrow\cY\) parameterized with \(\mbw\) that works at sample-level.

In this case we will only consider in-distribution test examples, i.e. examples that are drawn from the same distribution as the training examples. Specifically, we will use the same distribution for the test inputs \(p(\mbx)\) and the same distribution for the test weights \(p(\mbw)\) as those used during training.
