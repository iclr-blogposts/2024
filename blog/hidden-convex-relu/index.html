That sounds like great news but is it the case in practice? Let's find out together. </em></p> <p>The code for <em>this plot</em> is available and reproducible on this <strong><a href="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/hidden-convex-relu.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a></strong> (or in <strong><a href="/2024/assets/html/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/hidden-convex-relu.html">HTML</a></strong>).</p> <h2 id="i-overview-and-motivation">I. Overview and Motivation</h2> <p>50 years ago, two-layer networks with non-linear activations were known to be universal approximators, however, they did not catch on as they were hard to train. The recent years have been marked by deeper networks running on dedicated hardware with very large datasets. Those networks have since been at the top of the benchmark in many applications including self-driving and text generation. The pragmatic method to train such models is to run stochastic gradient descent on the non-convex optimization problem, which is concretely tuning the weights (and bias) until the model is accurate enough. The best models usually require billions of parameters and very large datasets. The training, in turn, requires millions of dollars of hardware and electricity to run gradient descent and train a single model.</p> <p>Deep learning is not without faults. Even though the test performance can surpass those of many machine learning models, it is very hard to know what the network has learned because of its black-box nature. Interpretability in neural networks is crucial for creating trustworthy AI systems, one of the biggest obstacle to AI adoption. It may also lead us to simpler models that are cheaper to run, are more robust, generalize better, and are easier to adapt to specific tasks.</p> <p>To figure out what a neural network learns, we will focus in this post on the training of a shallow ReLU network by vanilla gradient descent, using the full batch of data at each step, in a regression setting. More precisely, we will investigate how the construction of a convex equivalent to the non-convex training problem can enlighten us on how neurons evolve during the training phase, with a specific focus on the activation of the ReLU functions and their consequences.</p> <h3 id="problem-and-notation">Problem and notation</h3> <p>Our problem of interest will be the training of a simple two-layer neural network with ReLU activation. We focus on a classical regression problem with a mean squared error loss and we add a weight decay term (whose importance will be underlined later). This leads to the following full-batch gradient method (note that we make a slight abuse of notation by denoting by $\nabla$ the output of the derivative of the parameters, obtained, for instance, by backpropagation).</p> <p>Because there are only two layers, we will integrate the biases of the neurons directly into the data by adding a dimension filled with ones.</p> <p class="framed"> <b class="underline">Two-Layer ReLU Network Training</b><br> <b>Data points:</b> $n$ inputs \(\pmb{x}_j \in \RR^d\) and labels \(y_j \in \RR\), $j=1,..,n$<br> <b>Model:</b> $m$ neurons: First layer \(\pmb{w}_i \in \RR^d\), second layer \(\alpha_i \in \RR\), $i=1,..,m$<br> <b>Hyper-parameters:</b> step-size \(\step &gt; 0\), regularization \(\lambda\geq 0\) <br> <b>Loss to be minimized:</b> \begin{equation}\label{eq:theloss} \mathcal{L}(\pmb{W}, \pmb{\alpha}) = \sum_{j=1}^n \bigg( \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^m \max(0, \pmb{w}_i^\top \pmb{x}_j) \alpha_i}_{\text{Network's Output}} - y_j \bigg)^2 + \underbrace{\lambda \sum_{i=1}^m \| \pmb{w}_i \|^2_2 + \alpha_i^2}_{\text{Weight Decay}} \end{equation} <b>(Full-batch) Gradient Descent:</b> \begin{equation*} (\pmb{W}, \pmb{\alpha})_{t+1} = (\pmb{W}, \pmb{\alpha})_t - \step \nabla \mathcal{L}((\pmb{W}, \pmb{\alpha})_t) \end{equation*} </p> <p>Even the simplest ReLU models have non-trivial non-convexity as depicted in the figure below. We plot the loss function \(\mathcal{L}\) of a network with two neurons on one-dimensional data. We only optimize the first layer here so we have a total of two parameters to optimize. Despite the simple setup, a gradient descent starting from a random initialization can converge to three different values, two of them being bigger than zero. However, there always exists a path of non-increasing loss from initialization to the global minimum (as predicted by a <d-cite key="sharifnassabBoundsOverParameterizationGuaranteed2019"></d-cite>).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/threed-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/threed-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/threed-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/threed.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p class="legend">Loss landscape of a network with two parameters, one for each ReLU neuron, and two data points: $(x_1, y_1) = (-1, 1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (1, 2)$ are fixed. Since all labels are positive, we fix the second layer $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ to 1 to plot the loss in 2D without a loss of generality. The black lines represent the loss for only one neuron (since the other is equal to 0). The red lines(critical points) are paths of parameters for which the loss is constant and the gradient is zero. They represent the parameters for which the neuron fits exactly one data point and is deactivated for the other and thus suffers a loss of $(y_1)^2$ for the red line on the left and $(y_2)^2$ for the other. The exact formula to compute each point of the loss landscape is: \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \mathcal{L}(w_1, w_2) =&amp;\ \left(\max(0, x_1 w_1) + \max(0, x_1 w_2) - y_1\right)^2 \\ +&amp;\ \left(\max(0, x_2 w_1) + \max(0, x_2 w_2) - y_2\right)^2 \end{split} \end{equation*} </p> <p>To avoid the local minima, one idea is to add constraints to the parameters. The constrained problem where $w_1$ has to be positive and $w_2$ has to be negative, <em>is</em> convex, and a simple gradient descent will find the global minima of the original unconstrained problem. In <d-cite key="wangHiddenConvexOptimization2021"></d-cite>, they find a more general way to build an equivalent convex problem to our ReLU shallow network training problem.</p> <p>In this blog post, we will first work out the intuition needed to understand why an equivalent, finite convex problem even exists. Then we will study the exact links between the problem in practice and the convex problem, and go over the limits of such an approach both in theory and in practice.</p> <h3 id="research-context">Research context</h3> <p>The question of how neural networks learn is a very active domain of research with many different paths of investigation. Its main goal is to lay a mathematical foundation for deep learning and for that goal, shallow neural networks act as a stepping stone for understanding deeper and more complex networks.</p> <p>For networks with a hidden layer of infinite width, it is proven that gradient descent converges to one of the global minima<d-cite key="allen-zhuConvergenceTheoryDeep2019b"></d-cite><d-cite key="duGradientDescentProvably2018"></d-cite><d-cite key="jacotNeuralTangentKernel2018"></d-cite> under the <em>NTK regime</em>, or by considering them as Wasserstein gradient flows<d-cite key="chizatGlobalConvergenceGradient2018a"></d-cite>. <a href="https://rajatvd.github.io/NTK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying the NTK</a> amounts to analyzing the first-order Taylor expansion of the network, treating the network as a linear regression over a feature map. This approximation is accurate if the neurons are initialized with a large scale(far from zero), large enough that neurons do not move far from their initialization. This is also called the <em>lazy regime</em> <d-cite key="chizatLazyTrainingDifferentiable2019"></d-cite>, in contrast with the <em>feature learning regime</em> where neurons align themselves to a finite amount of directions. While it is noticeable, we are also interested here in a feature-learning regime with small initialization where we can observe actual non-convex behavior such as neuron alignment, incremental learning<d-cite key="berthierIncrementalLearningDiagonal2023"></d-cite> and saddle to saddle dynamic<d-cite key="boursierGradientFlowDynamics2022d"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Examining the loss landscape reveals that shallow networks with more neurons than data points always have a non-increasing path to a global minimum<d-cite key="sharifnassabBoundsOverParameterizationGuaranteed2019"></d-cite>. This is a favorable property for (stochastic) gradient convergence. In ‘<em>The Hidden Convex Optimization Landscape of Regularized Two-Layer ReLU Networks</em>‘<d-cite key="wangHiddenConvexOptimization2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="pilanciNeuralNetworksAre2020"></d-cite>, the authors extend those results by adding the weight decay regularization.</p> <p>Regularization plays a pivotal role as it let us influence which local minimum we will reach with gradient descent, usually to favor a simpler solution. Even if no explicit regularization is used, it is known that there is an implicit bias of gradient descent for linear activations, and more recently for ReLU networks<d-cite key="wangConvexGeometryBackpropagation2021"></d-cite> using the convex reformulation.</p> <p>Other convex approaches are limited to an infinite amount of neurons, or to optimization in neuron-by-neuron fashion <d-cite key="bachBreakingCurseDimensionality2017"></d-cite> which requires solving many non-convex problems. The setting studied here allows for any number of neurons.</p> <p>To sum up, the convex reformulation approach described in this post contrasts with what precedes by presenting results for a shallow network with <strong>finite width layers</strong>, in a <strong>regression</strong> setting with <strong>ReLU</strong> activation and <strong>weight decay</strong> regularization.</p> <h2 id="ii-convex-reformulation">II. Convex reformulation</h2> <h3 id="small-example-walkthrough">Small example walkthrough</h3> <p>First, let’s get familiar with and understand the inherent convexity caused by ReLU and the second layer.

However, doing so means it cannot activate $x_1$ and will incur a constant loss $(y_1)^2$.

In the specific example above, $x_2&gt;0$ is activated and $x_1&lt;0$ is not. If we fix the ReLU’s activation to this pattern and <strong>replace the max operators</strong> with \(\czero\) or \(\cone\):</p> <p> \begin{equation}\label{eq:firsttry} \min_{u_1 \in \RR} (\czero \times x_1 u_1 - y_1)^2+ (\cone \times x_2 u_1 - y_2)^2 \end{equation} </p> <p>This problem is convex. A gradient descent from any initialization will converge to the optimal loss $(y_1)^2$ with the parameter $u_1 =y_2/x_2$.

But keep in mind that we want to build an equivalent problem. If $u_2$ is positive, taking $w_1 = u_2$ does not lead to the same loss value in the original problem because a positive parameter will never activate the first data point.</p> <p>To make the issue obvious, consider this convex problem obtained by replacing the two $\max$ operators by \(\cone\):</p> <p> \begin{equation*} \min_{u_3 \in \RR} (\cone \times x_1 u_3 - y_1)^2+ (\cone \times x_2 u_3 - y_2)^2 \end{equation*} </p> <p>While it is convex, there is no link between the ReLU parameter $w_1$, and this new problem’s parameter $u_3$: it is not possible to activate both data points. This issue comes from the fact that replacing a $\max$ by \(\cone\) only makes sense if what is inside the $\max$ is indeed positive. In other words, as long as \(x_1 ~ w_1\) is positive we have that \(max(x_1 ~ w_1, 0) = \cone x_1 ~ w_1\).</p> <p> \begin{equation*} \min_{\substack{x_1 ~ u_3 \geq 0\\x_2 ~ u_3 \geq 0}} (\cone \times x_1 u_3 - y_1)^2+ (\cone \times x_2 u_3 - y_2)^2 \end{equation*} </p> <p>We added the constraints corresponding to the activation, and it adequately restricts $u_3$ to be in ${0}$.</p> <p>As a simple reformulation of \eqref{eq:firsttry}, we vectorize (in the number of data points) the convex loss and we add the constraints:</p> <p> \begin{equation*} \min_{\substack{\begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} u_1 \geq 0}} \ \ \bigg\| \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \czero &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \cone \end{bmatrix}}_{\text{diagonal activation matrix}} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} u_1 - \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} \bigg\|_2^2 \end{equation*} </p> <p>The diagonal activation matrix (named \(D_i \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times n}\)) summarize the on/off behavior of <em>one</em> ReLU for <em>all</em> data points. The constraints on $u_1$ are directly given by this activation matrix:</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} = 2 \begin{bmatrix} \czero &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \cone \end{bmatrix}- I_2 \qquad \text{$I_2$ the identity matrix of $\RR^2$}\] <p>The other way around, we can define the activation pattern vector for a specific parameter \(u\): \((\mathbb{1}_{u ~ x_j \geq 0})_{j=1\dots n} \in \{0,1\}^n\) with $n$ the number of data points. The activation matrix of \(u\) is simply the matrix that has this vector for its diagonal.</p> <p>So we have exactly four possible activation matrices. \(D_1 = (\begin{smallmatrix} \czero &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \czero \end{smallmatrix})\) and \(D_2 = (\begin{smallmatrix} \cone &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \cone \end{smallmatrix})\) will have constraints that reduce to $w_1 = 0$, making them not interesting.

If \(u_i\) respects the constraint, its activation pattern is exactly \(D_i\) and this is crucial to retrieve the optimal solution of the non-convex loss\eqref{eq:theloss} from the solution of the convex reformulation\eqref{eq:thecvx}.</p> <p>A conceptually easy way to have the two problems have the same global loss, is to consider a ReLU network with \(2^n\) neurons, and to formulate the convex problem using all \(2^n\) distinct activation matrices \(D_i\). In that case, it is easy to see that they both have the same expressivity.

If you consider a finite set of samples and a single ReLU, it will activate and deactivate some samples: this is called an activation pattern. A diagonal matrix \(\pmb{D}_i \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}\) describes one activation pattern, but not all are possible for a given dataset.

We plot the output of one ReLU unit initialized at \(\pmb{w}_1 = (0.3, 0.15)\), \(\alpha_1 = 1\). Therefore we have</p> <p> \begin{align*} \max(0, \pmb{w}_1^\top \pmb{x}_1) &amp;= 0 \\ \max(0, \pmb{w}_1^\top \pmb{x}_2) &amp;= \pmb{w}_1^\top \pmb{x}_2 \end{align*} </p> <p>The activation pattern of \(\pmb{w}_1\) is \(\pmb{D}_1=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} \czero &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \cone \end{smallmatrix}\right)\).

Can We Forget the Non-Convex Problem?</h2> <h3 id="solving-the-convex-problem-efficiently-is-hard">Solving the convex problem efficiently is hard</h3> <p>In the last ten years, deep neural networks have been trained using (stochastic) gradient descent on the non-convex problem. The algorithm, the implementation, and even the hardware running the training have been heavily optimized, supported, and pushed by industrial and scientific applications. Such networks were practically abandoned for years after being discovered because there did not exist an efficient way to train them. Nowadays, it takes a few lines to train a network on dedicated hardware and this might make us forget how much engineering has made this possible. This should be kept in mind when comparing a new approach to the problem.</p> <p>Training a network with the non-convex problem can be time consuming as it requires tuning hyperparameters and rollbacks(retrieving a previous state) to get out of a bad minimum.

Our non-convex problem is equivalent to a convex and well-specified optimization problem with constraints. The global optima might be the same, but training the network with gradient descent almost always leads to a local minimum. Because there are too many activations to consider them all, the convex problem only find a local minimum. However, it is not clear if they find the same kind of local minimum.</p> <p>Activation patterns can and will change during gradient descent in the non-convex problem. In some cases, this pattern shifting is useful because the new activation patterns may lead to a better minimizer. To verify this, we monitor the number of unique activation patterns used by the network at each step of a gradient descent. If two neurons have the same activation pattern (<em>i.e.</em> they activate and deactivate the same data points), we would count them as one.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/nbactiv-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/nbactiv-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/nbactiv-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/nbactiv.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p class="legend">Training a network with 100 random data points in 10 dimensions.

By default in popular libraries, <em>He initialization</em> <d-cite key="he2015delving"></d-cite> is used, it draws neurons from a normal distribution centered on 0 and with a variance in \(1/m\) with \(m\) the number of neurons.

Each green triangle represents one neuron with its activation point horizontally, and its norm vertically. The orientation of the triangle reveals which side the neuron will activate the data. At initialization, the repartition of the activation point is uniform. However, as training progresses most neurons that activate toward the right converge to $-1.3$. Once the norm of the neuron at activating at $-1.3$ is large enough, the loss decreases and we quickly reach convergence. </p> <p>Taking a look at the loss on the same problem, we can identify the two distinct regimes: alignment and fitting (then convergence).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/lastgif_plot-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/lastgif_plot-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/lastgif_plot-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2024/assets/img/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu/lastgif_plot.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p class="legend"> Plot of the loss during gradient descent in the same setting as the animation above.

In experiments, it is clear that adding momentum or using the Adam optimizer is much easier to use on top of being faster to converge. However, the behavior is much less predictable.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The main takeaway is that the best network for a given dataset can be found exactly by solving a convex problem. Additionally, the convex problem can describe every local minimum found by gradient descent in the non-convex setting. However, finding the global optima is impossible in practice, and approximations are still costly in precision. While there is no evident link between feature learning in the non-convex and the convex reformulation, many settings allow for a direct equivalence and the whole convex toolkit for proofs.</p> <p>The performance side of the convex reformulation will benefit from dedicated software as has been the case for gradient descent in deep networks. Only then will it offer a no-tuning alternative to costly stochastic gradient descent. In smaller settings, it already allows us to quickly find all the possible local minima that are so important in machine learning.</p> <p>Despite advancements in understanding the optimization landscape of neural networks, a significant gap persists in reconciling theory with practical challenges, notably because of early stopping. In real-world scenarios, networks often cease learning before reaching a local minimum and this has a direct impact (in large-scale initialization) but there are limited results.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2> <p><em>This work is partly funded by the ANR JCJC project ANR-21-CE23-0022-01.</em></p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/2024/assets/bibliography/2024-05-07-hidden-convex-relu.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article id="bibtex-container" class="related highlight"> For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as <pre id="bibtex-academic-attribution">
