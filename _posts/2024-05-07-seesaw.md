## Introduction

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have manifested significant proficiency in various graph learning tasks over recent years. Owing to their exemplary performance, GNNs have garnered increasing attention from both the research community and industrial practitioners. Consequently, there has been a notable transition away from the conventional and prevalent shallow graph embedding methods. However, in tandem with this transition, an imperative question arises â€” do GNNs always outperform shallow embedding methods in node representation learning? Despite the doubts cast by multiple recent studies, the field of graph machine learning still lacks a systematic understanding, which is essential for meticulously paving its advancement. In this blog post, we will explore the existing graph representation learning papers by discussing the impact of this work and examining how this work contributes to the advancement of graph embedding learning.
